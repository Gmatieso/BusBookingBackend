class RoutesController < ApplicationController
    #Rails was created with concepts of convection over configuration 
    #i.e views corresponds directly to controller file, which speaks directly with models

    # An app/models/article.rb model file that will contain: validations, database relationships, callbacks, and any custom logic for articles.
    # An app/controllers/articles_controller.rb file that will have methods to manage data flow for the article behavior, including the full set of CRUD features. The standard methods are: index, create, show, update, and destroy.
    # An app/views/articles directory that will contain a corresponding view for each of the pages that the end user will access. Note: in a Rails API application, we won't have a dedicated folder for our views like we would in a typical Rails MVC application.
